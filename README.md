# First Year Project Abstract

Proposal for first year project abstract

## Project Focus

The project will focus on BGS density split analysis using AbacusAurora simulations, based on discussions about:
- DESI Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) sample characteristics
- Density-based multitracer techniques with photometric neighbors
- MAP-based galaxy population modeling and environment tagging
- Survey systematics and photometric calibration considerations
